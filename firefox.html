<h2>A history of Firefox</h2>

  <p>The project which became Firefox started as an experimental branch of the <a
      href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a>
    Suite called m/b (or mozilla/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing
    appeared
    in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.

    Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking enabled
    by
    default to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control attribute in
    HTML5,
    dropping support for the blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element, the restriction to
    have to
    "switch to a different search provider across the entire browser," and a global browser console, a new network
    monitor
    among other things.</p>
