          <p class="well">The first Internet Explorer was derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyglass,_Inc.">Spyglass
            Mosaic</a>. The original Mosaic came from NCSA, but since NCSA was a public entity it relied on Spyglass as
            its
            commercial licensing partner. Spyglass in turn delivered two versions of the Mosaic browser to Microsoft, one
            wholly
            based on the NCSA source code, and another engineered from scratch but conceptually modeled on the NCSA
            browser.
            Internet Explorer was initially built using the Spyglass, not the NCSA source code. The license to Microsoft
            provided
            Spyglass (and thus NCSA) with a quarterly fee plus a percentage of Microsoft's revenues for the software.

            In March 2009 Version 8.0 was released, with the first public beta having been released on March 5, 2008. IE8
            offered
            better support for web standards than previous versions, with plans for improved support for RSS, CSS, and
            Ajax, as
            well as full compliance for Cascading Style Sheets 2.1. It was also the first version to successfully pass the
            Acid2
            test. In addition, Internet Explorer 8 included new features such as WebSlices and an improved phishing
            filter.</p>

        <div><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Mozilla_Firefox_logo_2013.png">

          <p class="well">The project which became Firefox started as an experimental branch of the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla</a>
            Suite called m/b (or mozilla/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing
            appeared
            in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.

            Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking enabled
            by
            default to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control attribute in
            HTML5,
            dropping support for the blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element, the restriction to
            have to
            "switch to a different search provider across the entire browser," and a global browser console, a new network
            monitor
            among other things.</p>

        <h2><a id="cr">A brief history of Chrome</a></h2>
        <div><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Google_Chrome_icon_%282011%29.svg">

          <p class="well"><a href="http://www.google.com">Google's</a> Eric Schmidt opposed the development of an independent web
            browser for
            six years. He stated that "at the time, Google was a small company," and he did not want to go through
            "bruising
            browser wars." After co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several Mozilla Firefox developers and built
            a
            demonstration of Chrome, however, Schmidt admitted that "It was so good that it essentially forced me to
            change my
            mind."

            In December 2010 Google announced that to make it easier for businesses to use Chrome they would provide an
            official
            Chrome MSI package. For business use it is helpful to have full-fledged MSI packages that can be customized
            via
            transform files (.mst) - but the MSI provided with Chrome is only a very limited MSI wrapper fitted around the
            normal
            installer, and many businesses find that this arrangement does not meet their needs.</p>
