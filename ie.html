<h2>A history of Internet Explorer</h2>

<div class="browser"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/10/Internet_Explorer_7_Logo.png">

  <p>The first Internet Explorer was derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyglass,_Inc.">Spyglass
    Mosaic</a>. The original Mosaic came from NCSA, but since NCSA was a public entity it relied on Spyglass as
    its
    commercial licensing partner. Spyglass in turn delivered two versions of the Mosaic browser to Microsoft, one
    wholly
    based on the NCSA source code, and another engineered from scratch but conceptually modeled on the NCSA
    browser.
    Internet Explorer was initially built using the Spyglass, not the NCSA source code. The license to Microsoft
    provided
    Spyglass (and thus NCSA) with a quarterly fee plus a percentage of Microsoft's revenues for the software.

    In March 2009 Version 8.0 was released, with the first public beta having been released on March 5, 2008. IE8
    offered
    better support for web standards than previous versions, with plans for improved support for RSS, CSS, and
    Ajax, as
    well as full compliance for Cascading Style Sheets 2.1. It was also the first version to successfully pass the
    Acid2
    test. In addition, Internet Explorer 8 included new features such as WebSlices and an improved phishing
    filter.</p>
